# Alternative Language Project

I chose JavaScript, including Node.js version 21.6.1, for my project due to its versatility and broad application in both back- and front-end development. With Node.js, JavaScript provides a stable platform for server-side development, making it perfect for tasks like file operations and data processing. Its extensive set of tools and frameworks provides solutions for a variety of requirements, including managing user input, processing file ingestion, and efficiently implementing complex logic.

JavaScript's support for object-oriented programming (OOP) makes it possible for developers to create classes and objects with constructor functions or ES6 classes, making it simple to structure code into reusable components. File ingestion operations are straightforward with Node.js' built-in fs module, which has methods for reading and writing files. Conditional statements like `if`, `else if`, and `switch` enable decision-making under many situations, while assignment statements and loops provide methods for data manipulation and iteration.

Subprograms, which are known as functions or methods in JavaScript, are important components of the language's architecture because they allow for the packaging of functionality into reusable pieces of code. While I did not use unit testing in my project, JavaScript does support it using libraries such as Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine. These testing frameworks enable developers to create tests that test the functionality of specific code elements (like functions, methods, or classes). Also, JavaScript has vast exception handling via `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks, providing means for smooth error handling and recovery.

## Libraries Used

* **Readline**: This built-in Node.js module enabled interaction with the command-line interface (CLI), allowing users to just input data and make selections.
* **FS** (File System): Part of Node.js, it was essential for tasks such as reading CSV data from files and simplifying file manipulation operations within the application.
* **RegExp**: With JavaScript's built-in regular expression support, this made it possible to search for patterns and extract specific data from strings. It was useful for tasks like parsing and verifying data, which improved the program's data processing capabilities.
